Going out tonight. Changes into something red. Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress. Everything she never had, she showing up. Driving too fast. Moon is breaking through a hill. She's heading for something that you won't forget. Having no regrets is all that you really want. Baby. And I've been thinking about it lately. Crazy just how fast the night changes. Everything that you've ever. Well in. Changes. Chasing it tonight. Doubts are running round her head. He's waiting hides behind a cigaret. Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop. Moving too fast. Moon is lighting up her skin. She's falling. Doesn't even know it yet. Having no regrets is all that she really wants. We're only getting old. If you crazy just how fast and. Changes. Everything that you've ever. Going out tonight. Changes into something red. Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress. Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she loves. You crazy? Just. When the night changed. When the night changes. Baby. You never. Me and you.
