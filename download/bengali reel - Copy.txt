I find Bengalis very cute. They can make anything sound cute. I was dating a Bengali girl once. My name is plain simple. In the middle of the market, she would say Manush in the middle of the market. I'm half turned on. Yeah, boy. And then there would be an odia guy. Hey, Manasa. To shorten. Shorten your arm turned on.
