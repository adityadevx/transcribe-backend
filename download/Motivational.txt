You can't live in LA and wake up at 8:00 in the morning. It's 11:00 on the East Coast. The stock market been open two hours. They already making decisions about your life and your ass was asleep. The Bible says he who loves to sleep and the folding of hands. Poverty will set upon you like a thief in the night.
